# Fish Face

A silly game created for [Ludum Dare 57](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/fish-face).

Ludum Dare gave me an excuse to try learning [Flame Engine](https://flame-engine.org/).

I wrote [a lengthy blog post](https://paulgestwicki.blogspot.com/2025/04/ludum-dare-57-weekend-with-flame.html) 
about my experience creating this game.
